                <p>The York Rite of Freemasonry is a system of degrees which include those of the lodge, chapter, council and commandery, often
                referred to as American Rite Masonry. While most of the degrees of this rite were born and nurtured in England, yet it is in
                North America that they have attained their highest development, and it is in America that there is a regular arrangement of
                the degrees. In the U.S., they are often referred to as &quot;Ancient Craft Masonry&quot; and in bringing them all under that
                heading, we see that they are related to the Symbolic Degrees conferred in the Lodge. The York Rite can be viewed as an
                aggregate of four Bodies, forming one whole, and one cannot stop on the way and have a complete understanding of Ancient Craft
                Masonry. Membership in the Chapter, Council and Commandery is by petition while membership in the College and Allied Masonic
                Degrees is by invitation only. For now, we will discuss only the 4 bodies considered to by York Rite Bodies, the Lodge,
                Chapter, Council and Commandery.</p><br>

            <br>
            <p>If you are a master mason, all you have to do is petition the other bodies. They will be glad to add you to their ranks. The
            only restriction is that in order to receive the Order of the Temple, you must believe and practice Christian virtues and believe
            in Jesus Christ. You will be glad that you received these degrees as they complete and amplify the degrees of the Symbolic Lodge.
            The most common remark made by Masons who receive these degrees is that they wonder why they took so long to petition to receive
            them. Remember, you were taught early in your Symbolic Degrees that Freemasonry is a progressive science, attained only be degrees.
            You may not be able to be active in the work of the York Rite, but you will be glad that you took the degrees. There are no
            lectures to learn before you progress, so the small amount of time it takes to receive these degrees is well worth the
            time.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>So that you can be better informed about these degrees, we will give you a small synopsis of each degree, beginning with that of
            Mark Master; the first degree of the Chapter. Each of the bodies has a separate page that tells about each degree along with a
            little history of our local bodies.</p>

            <p>The opening degree of the Royal Arch Chapter is regarded by many Masons to be one of the most interesting degrees in all
            Freemasonry. The work of the Temple continues and this degree takes you back to the Fellowcraft degree. Not only does this degree
            compliment the Fellowcraft degree, but many say that it actually completes it. The scene of this degree is laid in one of the many
            workshops erected near King Solomon&#39;s Temple, and the candidate is taught many interesting historical facts, as well as given
            practical demonstrations of the value of <span id="styleRed">Honesty</span> and <span id="styleRed">Charity</span>.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The Jewish half-shekel of silver is often mentioned in the scriptures and is referred to in this degree. While it is worth less
            than 25 cents in our currency, yet Masonic tradition proves that no amount is insignificant in the face of urgent need.</p><br>

            <p>For many years this degree was conferred upon those who had served as Masters of Masonic Lodges. This degree began the
            preparation for the Royal Arch, which was removed from the Symbolic Degrees of which it was once a part. Originally, only actual
            Past Masters of Lodges were admitted to the sublime secrets of the Royal Arch which meant that very few could receive them. The
            Degree of Past Master, now called virtual or chapter Past Master, teaches the candidate that he must first learn to obey before he
            can rule, and to govern himself before he can govern others and fulfills the obligation and qualifies him for advancement. The
            degree deals primarily with the administration of a Symbolic Lodge, retaining some of the old instruction once given to those who
            were actually chose to preside. One cannot keep from noticing the parallels of this degree with the actual installation ceremonies
            used today for most Lodge officers.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The gavel is very properly used as the emblem of this degree because it has very generally been accepted as an emblem of
            authority and power. The gavel is used in all deliberative bodies today, more as a means of calling for order than of demonstrating
            power vested in its user. The degree teaches the value of <span id="styleRed">Harmony</span> and <span id=
            "styleRed">Justice</span>.</p><br>

            It is here, amid much rejoicing and great splendor, the labors of the craft are given the blessing of the Lord descending as fire
            from heaven. It is here that King Solomon in his gratitude, received and acknowledged them as Most Excellent Masters and empowered

            <p>In this degree we find the actual completion of the Master’s Degree and the recovery of the Word. After the death of King
            Solomon, his magnificent Temple was destroyed and the Israelites carried away captive to Babylon. Here they lived for about 70
            years, many of them acquiring considerable wealth, and some attaining high rank and influence in the Chaldean government. However,
            when liberated by King Cyrus, many of them returned to Jerusalem and began rebuilding the Temple. While this work was going on and
            rubbish of the ruins of the first Temple cleared away, many interesting and valuable discoveries were made, chief of which leads to
            the recovery of the lost Word.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>This degree while based upon the subject of love of Home and Country, teaches us the lessons of <span id=

            <p>This degree once again takes us back in time to the building of King Solomon’s temple, to a particular day prior to the death of
            the Master Builder. Hiram Abif and a young craftsman by the name of Adoniram are the principal characters in this degree. Here, the
            master builder imparts to the candidate sublime teachings of a useful labor on Earth, and gives him valuable instruction as to the
            preservation of our valuable secrets. This degree is very illustrative and complementary to the third and seventh degrees (Royal
            Arch). In fact, this is the only degree in Masonry that conveys to the candidate why the Word was lost. An inattentive candidate
            will miss this most important explanation. This degree also explains some symbols of Freemasonry and teaches the great lesson of
            right living and the building here on Earth of that superstructure necessary for the erection of our spiritual temple.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The Holy Vessels are the proper symbols for this degree, for the were the work on one of the most skilled artisans of the day.
            They teach the necessity of having perfect bodies and minds to house man’s immortal soul.</p><br>

            <p>This degree also historically occurs prior to the Master Mason’s Degree. It is the second in the series of three dramatic
            degrees conferred by the Council. The degree ends with the great tradition which runs all through Freemasonry, and constitutes and
            explanation, satisfactory in all details, as to certain traditional happenings, a knowledge of which is necessary for a proper
            understanding of the story of Freemasonry. This degree is very complementary of the Royal Arch Degree and is necessary to truly
            understand how the Word was recovered.</p><br>

            <p>It teaches a wonderful lesson - that of overlooking the failings of those who through ignorance or curiosity may often overstep

            <p>This degree is actually an honorary degrees conferred upon Select Masters and is usually conferred only on special occasions and
            upon large classes of candidates. While the scene of this degree is laid many centuries ago, the lessons portrayed are just as
            essential in the present age. This dramatic and impressive degree deals with circumstances and incidents during the siege of
            Jerusalem, and the final destruction of the Temple of Solomon. There is not question as to its historical and Masonic value,

            temple is that spiritual temple, which each erects within himself.</p><br>

            <p>In the Chivalric or Templar system, the degrees are termed Orders rather than degrees. This Order continues the story of the
            Jewish people, from their darkest hour to the time of the rebuilding of the Temple. The lesson taught is that of <span id=
            "styleRed">Truth</span>, which often crushed will rise again, for in the end it is might and will prevail over all forms of error
            and superstition.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>We again revert back to the period of the Royal Arch Degree, when the Jews were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild
            the Temple. One of their number prevails upon the King to restore to the new Temple the Holy Vessels carried away by the Babylonian
            armies when the first Temple was destroyed. In presenting his plea before <span id="styleRed">Darius the King</span>, a powerful
            testimony to the almighty force of <span id="styleRed">Truth</span> was offered, and a new Order founded, which is a fitting
            foundation stone for the Orders that follow.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The Red Cross is truly the emblem of this illustrious Order, for each of its four arms have important symbolic allusions. The
            degree encourages the search for truth, and emphasizes the important of Liberty and Justice, with a right to worship Deity under
            whatever name he may be called.</p><br>

            <p>Shifting to the time of the Crusades, admission to the Mediterranean Pass is sought, that a safe pilgrimage to the Holy
            Sepulchre might be undertaken. This is a very sublime and sacred Order, which culminates in the enrollment of the suppliant as a
            Knight of Malta.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The Order is strictly Christian in origin and character, and while there are no restrictions as to who many receive it, yet one
            who did not believe in the practice of Christian principles would be embarrassed in petitioning for the Order. For its locale is
            laid among scenes and characters referred to in the New Testament and it constitutes a Masonic interpretation along Christian lines
            of the New Dispensation. The Order receives it name fro the Island of Malta. A Priory of Knights Malta still exists on this ancient
            Isle.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The Maltese Cross is the proper emblem for this Order, for it was officially conferred upon the membership during the Crusades,
            and the modern Order in remembrance, have perpetuated the symbols standing for all that was true and holy.</p><br>

            <p>No Degree or Order in Masonry is more solemn, more impressive, or more soul-searching than the Order of the Temple. Often
            referred to as Knight Templar, it is the climax of the Christian Orders of Knighthood. The Order receives its name from those
            Crusaders who were sworn to protect pilgrims and uphold the Cross, and who became the first Christian protectors of Jerusalem,
            their exploits thrilling all Christendom for ages. It becomes a fitting climax to the labors of the humble penitent, who has
            faithfully performed the symbolic seven years of preparation for this consummation of his endeavors, his knighting as a Christian
            Warrior.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>The Knights Templar are often remembered because of their close association with the site of the Temple, during the number of
            years that they occupied and held Jerusalem. The Ancient Order of the Temple has been dispersed, and the warlike spirit of the
            Order has passed away, but here remains a spirit of refined and moral Chivalry, which prompts its members to be ever ready to
            defend the weak, the innocent, the helpless and the oppressed, and thus warrant the title of Knight Templar.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>he true emblem of a Knight Templar is the Passion Cross. The Cross has ever been the symbol of sacrifice and coupled with the
            crown of the Kings of Kings, we are ever reminded of that sacrifice made by our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><br>
